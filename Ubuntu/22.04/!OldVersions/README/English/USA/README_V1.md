# Ubuntu 22.04

## System76 experience

I recently got a new System76 laptop on June 8th, after waiting 3 months for Dell to make any reply, and then ending up not sending it for an unknown reason. I might be done with Dell at this point, in less than 24 hours, System76 did more than Dell did in 90+ days. So far, it is a very good laptop, it has a few problems I am working out, but it is an upgrade over the last.

Current issues:

- [ ] Battery life (major)
- [ ] Touchpad issues (medium)
- [ ] Getting used to the keyboard (minor)

Since I waited too long to get another laptop with Ubuntu 20.04, I had to get one with Ubuntu 22.04. I decided not to get Pop!OS this time, as I didn't know enough about it. I may get it next time.

## Configuration

I was going to get a Lemur Pro, but the link became a HTTP 500 page the next day.

Other new applications:

> I was wanting to try this out, I haven't gotten to it yet.
* VirtualBox
> Set for very minimal usage, only for when absolutely necessary. I plan to get back into virtual machines in a more serious manner, but it will be done on a desktop, and not a laptop.
> > Active virtual machines
- - - [ ] Ubuntu 20.04 (8 GB RAM, 64 GB Disk, 1 core, 100% utilization)
* SuperTuxKart
> I wanted to try this game out, I had an interest in it, as I refer to it as the Mario Kart of the open source world. Unfortunately, the game refuses to load.
* YT-DLP
> Because YouTube-DL is unfortunately no longer developed, and is losing more and more functionality as time goes on.

## Thoughts on GNOME 42

GNOME 42 isn't as bad as I thought. I still don't like it too much, but it isn't as much of a downgrade from GNOME 3 as I thought.

## Firefox

I was stressed out about getting all my Firefox profiles to load onto the next device for months. It was actually incredibly easy. No errors, although the Firefox 89+ interface is horrific, and makes things harder. It also auto-updated from 99.0.1 to 101.0 and now scrollbars aren't present within GitHub source editing. I am starting to learn to accept updates as they come.

## Gedit

Gedit supports several new languages, but still doesn't support Assembly or Elm.
