Installing Seanpm2001/My-Linux-setup
---

Seanpm2001/My-Linux-setup currently doesn't require installation, it is just a collection of scripts and data. It contains several useful scripts for enhancing Linux usage and personalization, but the scripts have not been tested yet, run them at your own risk.

If you want to load the first project language file, you will need to have an BASH IDE/Interpreter and a package of any version of the BASH scripting language.

If you want to view the image files, the majority of files are in PNG format. Make sure your computer can handle images of 1920x200000/2560x1440/2560x1080/1920x1080 resolution well, and that your computer can handle JPG files.

Some image files are in other formats, such as SVG, and JPG. You will need support for viewing these files to view these files.

Some included files are in Markdown format (*.md) for best viewing, you should use a markdown viewer/markdown editor.

Some included files are in PDF format. They should be opened with a document viewer capable of handling PDF documents.
