# YouTube-dl
# Unfortunately, YouTube-DL was taken down from GitHub due to an unfair DMCA complaint made by the RIAA. They seem to be going back to their useless, childish Napster methods.
# Note to the RIAA: Taking down 1 YouTube video downloader is not going to do anything to help your cause. You just cut the hydras head again, this hydra has over a million heads due to how many times it has been cut.
# I really enjoyed YouTube-DL, it was my 9th video downloading tool, and it was the best working one out of all of them so far. I am hoping the people being YouTube-DL can stand up to the RIAA and make an objection
